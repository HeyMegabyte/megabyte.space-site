[DockerSlim](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim), now rebranded as **Slim**, is a tool that is used for creating optimized and secure Docker containers. It works by analyzing the contents of a Docker image and removing any unnecessary or redundant files, which can help to significantly reduce the size of the container and improve its performance.

## Improve CI/CD

One way that DockerSlim can be used to improve CI/CD is by speeding up the build and deployment process. By creating smaller and more optimized containers, DockerSlim can help to reduce the time required to upload, download, and deploy container images, which can help to streamline the development process and increase overall productivity.

## Enhance Security

Additionally, DockerSlim can help to improve the security of containerized applications by removing any unnecessary dependencies or files that could potentially introduce vulnerabilities or increase the attack surface of the application. This can help to reduce the risk of security breaches and other cyber threats, which can be especially important for businesses operating in sensitive industries or handling sensitive data.

## Efficient, Secure, and Scalable

Overall, leveraging DockerSlim as part of a CI/CD pipeline can help businesses to create more efficient, secure, and scalable containerized applications, while also reducing infrastructure costs and improving overall development productivity.
