If you want an efficient development team, you should make it as easy as possible for your developers to develop. One way you can do this is by packaging pre-made operating systems, complete with all the bells and whistles so your developers do not have to fuss over things like `adb` missing from the `PATH`. Our Self-Service Portal addresses this issue by integrating with your cloud provider so that your team can access fully-configured environments, optimized for working with your codebase at will.
